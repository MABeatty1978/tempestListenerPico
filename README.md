# tempestListenerPico

This program is a basic server designed to run on a Raspberry Pi Pico W.  It scans a local network on port 50222 which is what the Tempest Weatherflow hub uses to broadcast UPD messages

To use, edit the config.py file with your local SSID and network PASSWORD.  Then copy both .py files to your Raspberry Pi Pico W.
